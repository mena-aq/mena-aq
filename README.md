Hello! üòÄ 
This is my Github page, the home to all my personal and course projects!

Who Am I ? My name is Menahil, and I'm a Second Year Computer Science student always looking to further her knowledge about the complex world powering all our technical systems!

I love programming and learning about all the behind-the-scenes computations that power our world 

I've explored many fields of learning, and have enjoyed making projects to enhance my learning and showcase my skills, including Front-End Development, Game Development, C++ Programming, x86 Assembly, and Data Analysis / Scripting using Python!
